CoAPTrafficGeneratorServer
==========================

CoapTrafficGenerator Server application for Java


##Requirements
Like the mobile application, the server application uses Californium, and wants it in its build path. The server application also wants the mobile application in its build path. Lastly, the server application build path must include a library, JNetPcap.Í¾ its jnetpcap.4 jar file will suffice. However, the server also needs to be able to reach a JNetPcap binary. In a Windows environment, this is jnetpcap.dll which may be placed in the C:\Windows\System32 folder.
